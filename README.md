plugin_courses
==============
Creates a custom post type for courses. Includes fields for: title, course description, number of credits, instructor name, prerequisites, course website, course times, and class limit.

You must designate the course as either Undergraduate, Graduate, or both for the course to display properly.

Remember to designate your academic department for each course. This will allow for better searching and cross listing

To create a course display page:
==============
Create a new page
The page url must either be 'graduate-courses' or 'undergraduate-courses'. You can edit this under the Title field.
Choose "Courses" from the "Template" drop down on the right side.
Any content you enter in the editor will display above the course listings.
Publish your page
